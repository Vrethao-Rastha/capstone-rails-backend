  body: "I met a man today. A broken idealist, much like I hope I once was. He believes that the Commonwealth can be turned around. I’m not sure I agree. I don’t know why I agreed to help him. Even if we could turn everything around and create this perfect world, what place would there be for me in it? I’m a monster. A fiend.  Perhaps the only road to redemption left to me is to die trying to create this brave new world. Were I a religious woman, I would be a lot more concerned about what may be waiting for me when this body finally fails. So this is my new purpose in life? Can I dedicate myself to trying to build something lasting on the bones of my failure? Maybe that will be enough.",

    body: "I killed a man with a sledge hammer today. That would normally hold more weight than it does these days. My pipegun jammed, he was running at me with some kind of bladed tire iron in hand. I hit him in the chest, noting the odd vibrations that traveled up the handle as his ribs and sternum shattered. As he lay there, choking on his own blood, I felt nothing. I left him there, drowning in blood. That distant part of me that screams at night in my dreams was calm. I know this place is stealing the last shreds of my humanity. All I want is a safe place for Heather and me, where we can live in peace and be left alone. Every day I spend in this place moves me closer to those mindless feral ghouls that aimlessly wander the countryside. Where must we wander this wasteland, we who search for our better selves?",

      body: "I found my way to the old cemetery behind the drive-in today. Not sure what led my feet that direction. Maybe I had intended to find an open grave and fill it. Not sure there was any plan at all. I used to find the stone benches and trees comforting, I do remember that. I found none of that serenity this visit. What I did find was another lost soul.  A woman named Heather who had lost her sister. I think that collective loss brought us together, not that there’s anyone in this hollow place that doesn’t wear loss and pain as we used to wear designer clothing. Its nice to have someone around. In all honesty, before she saw me and called out to me, I’m not sure the last time I spoke. The difficulty I had in making my voice work was telling. All those raiders I killed in the Air Force base, and the ones in the Corvega plant the following day, I don’t think I said a thing. I don’t even talk to the dog anymore. She agreed to come back with me to the Red Rocket I’ve been living in. As the light failed, distant gunfire echoed around the countryside. Strange what a person can get used to.",

It was hard to know who was more crazy... me... or everyone else.I no longer remember the context, but I find it comforting.I went home today. Or to what used to be my home.An abandoned ruin, just dry bones.It feels like someone else’s life now. Did I really used to live here, or have I cracked and created this comforting illusion?A mother seeking a lost son. Not a new tale, for humanity in general, or in the Commonwealth specifically.It would be easy enough to just lie down, stop wandering and end it. There is some appeal in that. Another old quote: Hope is a mistake. If you can’t fix whats broken, you’ll go insane.And yet here I am, writing this journal on this battered old Pipboy.I found some food and water in an old cellar behind one of these ruined houses.When the sun rises I’ll set off for Concord.",

Or dead.I guess time has a way of smoothing over the corners of memory, but as I stood on the western border of the Commonwealth that day, I wasn’t sure it was worth going any further.Then some fool raider decided to try to shoot my dog.So now this place can burn, as far as I’m concerned.I don’t know if she was bloodthirsty and tried to kill everyone she met out here, or was just hungry.It the end, it hardly mattered. She tried to kill me, so I killed her.Just another day in the Commonwealth.There is a distant part of me that often wonders: there are so few of us left. A shade, clinging to the bones of its former glory.I don’t even know how many I’ve killed. No more than tried to kill me to be sure, but every death brings humanity one step closer to our inevitable end.There are those who say that we can yet rebuild, that extinction isn’t inevitable.Personally, I think we died 200 years ago, and the body hasn’t stopped twitching yet.I think I’ll end this here. Even I can’t maintain this level of melancholy forever.Just another day in the Commonwealth…",

She had designs to look for salvage in the old Super Duper Mart. While she was unsuccessful in that (too many Ghouls in the area) she tells me that as the storm passed, she saw a single, blood splattered figure emerge from the assembly plant with a equally macabre painted Mr Handy in tow. She wisely stayed out of sight, and quickly left the city. What happened inside, and who this mysterious figure could be remain a topic for speculation. There can be no question, however, that Lexington has been very quiet of late. Be careful out there, Commonwealthers.",

I’m sure most of you also know by now, rumors have been swirling that it was attacked by the institute, and every man, woman and child was slaughtered. At least in part, these rumors are true. Witnesses have come forward to inform me that The Institute was indeed responsible. Reports put the count anywhere from 50 to 500 synth solders surrounded the settlement, and when it was over, there was no one left alive. Keep your loved ones close, readers.

According to our own Ellie Perkins, The Valkyrie came into the office looking to hire Nick, only to find that he’d gone missing. On Ellie’s behest, a deal was made and The Valkyrie agreed to find him and bring him back, being directed to the subway station under Boston Commons. The details are sketchy, and Mr Valentine never talks about a case, but one of my informants reports Skinny Malone and his entire gang lay rotting in the corpse of Park Street Subway station. This leads us again to the question: Who is this woman. What does she want? And how is one person leaving a trail of corpses in her wake that would give a Deathclaw a run for its money?

If this is to be believed, we either have a new Raider Warlord on our hands, or something else less clear. What we do know is that whomever this mysterious person be, they have been reported at or leaving the scenes of what can only be massacres of various Raider Warbands. Who is this person?

  body: "A new rumor claims a new raider faction has been spotted in the western reaches of the Commonwealth. Some have suggested, often around a bottle of Bobrov Vodka, that they are the solders of The Valkyrie. They go on to say that she is often seen in the company of that odd Mr Handy, and has a habit of leaving a large body count in her wake as well. While both those facts are undeniably true, I don’t believe this is a fair claim. For one thing, The Valkyrie has, as far as we know, only killed raiders, gunners and triggermen. Our own Piper Wright and Nick Valentine claim, while obviously a little unhinged, they don’t believe she would kill innocent people. At least not without being provoked. No, while the Commonwealth’s newest and most interesting resident may be many things, I don’t believe a raider warlord is one of them.",
